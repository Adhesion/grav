grav CHANGELOG
==============

Version 0.2.0
--------------

* Added visual session manager - video sessions can be shifted between the main
  list and the available list, you can 'change channels' within the available
  list, and you can enable automatic channel changing with the lower-left
  button. Appears at the bottom of the screen on mouseover.
* Added the ability to orbit videos around the globe (according to their
  lat/long from RTP location) by pressing the 'o' key.
* Added --thumbnail-file option - given a text file, grav will parse it and make
  associations between videos (by name) and an alternate address, enabling the
  ability to switch to that address on double-click (assuming the address is in
  the available list).
* Added application icon (by Victoria Murray)
* Fixed miscellaneous sizing bugs (objects will resize correctly on name change)

Version 0.1.0
-------------

* Initial release
